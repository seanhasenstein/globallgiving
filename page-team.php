				<h3>Mark Rolison</h3>
				<p class="title">Founder</p>
				<p class="bio">As an avid entrepreneur, it has been one of Mark's personal goals to help people improve their lives through business and philanthropy. As a life-long athlete, the idea for GloBall Giving came to Mark while leading a Habitat for Humanity trip to Kenya. Upon experiencing the pure elation of 250 school children after receiving a mere 3 soccer balls, Mark’s life light bulb went off. Being able to combine sports, healthy life styles, recycling goods and helping children was a dream come true. Mark sits on a few local board of directors, leads Habitat for Humanity trips, enjoys traveling, cooking and coaching/participating in anything his two daughters Khendel and Ella get in to.</p>
